# Helpers for partially automated grading in [Ans](https://ans.app/)

This library can help you automate some tasks when grading assignments in [Ans](https://ans.app/).
Basically, it gives you a way to run scripts on each answer, while adding the output of those scripts as flags.

I use this for my own courses, and my grading scripts are not part of this release.
This means that documentation is rather absent, at least for now.
If you are interested in using this, please get in touch and I will see if I can whip up an example.
